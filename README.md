# Data-Gloves-for-Sign-Language-Translation
This study involves the development of data gloves for sign language that translates sign language to speech and help in real-time communication. By attaching flex sensors to the gloves, the system detects and interprets the movement of the hand and the fingers, obtaining bend angles to translate the hand movements into speech or text format. The bend angles of each finger is calculated and based on the combination of angles of all the fingers, the prediction is made. This system helps sign language users to communicate with the non-users in real-time. This technology can help people with hearing impairments communicate easily and more effectively to express their thoughts among people who do not know sign language.
